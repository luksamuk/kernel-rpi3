This is an attempt at slowly implementing a Raspberry Pi 3 bare-metal kernel, based
on Zoltan Baldaszti's tutorial (https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial).

You'll find more info over there; my main goal is to actually build a Lisp system
that could run on the RPi3, so this is only a step towards it. Don't take this
repository seriously.
