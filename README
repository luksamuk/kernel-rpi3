This is an attempt at slowly implementing a Raspberry Pi 3 bare-metal kernel, based
on David Welch's tutorial (https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi).

You'll find more info over there; my main goal is to actually build a Lisp system
that could run on the RPi3, so this is only a step towards it. Don't take this
repository seriously.
